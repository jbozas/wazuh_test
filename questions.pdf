● What problems did you have?
- Time: I had to priorize the level of detail that I could reach by the time that I had. Some things that I should improve if 
the test was shorter: 
    - Configure pre-commit (LOW)
    - Dockerize (LOW)
    - Add config file (no tan LOW)
    - Add serializers (LOW)
    - Separate task app and user app. Separate views and models within the apps.

- I had problems regarding to the framework knowledge. I had to search, read, test things specifics about Flask and SQLAlchemy.

● Did you make any changes to the specified API design?
Not really, I created four models instead of two, to save the Company and Address data apart from tasks and users.

● Explain any additional endpoints that you may have added, and document their parameters and response format.
I didn't add any extra endpoint apart from what the test ask for.
